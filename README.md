## Run using Docker

```bash
docker run -d -p 8081:8081 -v /path/to/downloads:/downloads --user 1001:1001 alexta69/metube
```

## Run using docker-compose

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  metube:
    image: alexta69/metube
    container_name: metube
    restart: unless-stopped
    user: "1001:1001"
    ports:
      - "8081:8081"
    volumes:
      - /path/to/downloads:/downloads
```

## Configuration via environment variables

Certain values can be set via environment variables, using the `-e` parameter on the docker command line, or the `environment:` section in docker-compose.

* __DOWNLOAD_DIR__: path to where the downloads will be saved. Defaults to `/downloads` in the docker image, and `.` otherwise.
* __AUDIO_DOWNLOAD_DIR__: path to where audio-only downloads will be saved, if you wish to separate them from the video downloads. Defaults to the value of `DOWNLOAD_DIR`.
* __URL_PREFIX__: base path for the web server (for use when hosting behind a reverse proxy). Defaults to `/`.
* __OUTPUT_TEMPLATE__: the template for the filenames of the downloaded videos, formatted according to [this spec](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/master/README.md#output-template). Defaults to `%(title)s.%(ext)s`.

## Chrome extension

[Rpsl](https://github.com/rpsl) has created a Chrome extension that allows right-clicking a video and sending it to MeTube. You can install it from [Google Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metube-downloader/fbmkmdnlhacefjljljlbhkodfmfkijdh) or use developer mode and install [from sources](https://github.com/Rpsl/metube-browser-extension).

## Bookmarklet

[kushfest](https://github.com/kushfest) has created a Chrome bookmarklet for sending the currently open webpage to MeTube. Please note that if you're on an HTTPS page, your MeTube instance must be behind an HTTPS reverse proxy (see below) for the bookmarklet to work.

GitHub doesn't allow embedding JavaScript as a link, so the bookmarklet has to be created manually by copying the following code to a new bookmark you create on your bookmarks bar. Change the hostname in the URL below to point to your MeTube instance.

```javascript
javascript:!function(){xhr=new XMLHttpRequest();xhr.open("POST","https://metube.domain.com/add");xhr.send(JSON.stringify({"url":document.location.href,"quality":"best"}));xhr.onload=function(){if(xhr.status==200){alert("Sent to metube!")}else{alert("Send to metube failed. Check the javascript console for clues.")}}}();
```

[shoonya75](https://github.com/shoonya75) has contributed a Firefox version:
```javascript
javascript:(function(){xhr=new XMLHttpRequest();xhr.open("POST","https://metube.domain.com/add");xhr.send(JSON.stringify({"url":document.location.href,"quality":"best"}));xhr.onload=function(){if(xhr.status==200){alert("Sent to metube!")}else{alert("Send to metube failed. Check the javascript console for clues.")}}})();
```

## Running behind a reverse proxy

Use the following nginx configuration to run MeTube behind a reverse proxy. The extra `proxy_set_header` directives are there to make WebSocket work. Don't forget to set the URL_PREFIX environment variable to the correct value as well.

```
location /metube/ {
        proxy_pass http://metube:8081;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
}
```

If you're using the [linuxserver/swag](https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/swag) image for your reverse proxying needs (which I can heartily recommend), it already includes ready snippets for proxying MeTube both in [subfolder](https://github.com/linuxserver/reverse-proxy-confs/blob/master/metube.subfolder.conf.sample) and [subdomain](https://github.com/linuxserver/reverse-proxy-confs/blob/master/metube.subdomain.conf.sample) modes under the `nginx/proxy-confs` directory in the configuration volume.

## Build and run locally

A Docker image can be built locally (it will build the UI too):

```bash
make build
```

### Run dev mode with local docker

```bash
make serve-dev
```
It will launch two containers: `metube-dev-frontend` and `metube-dev-backend`. Frontend will be started in watching mode but backend need to be restarted after code changes - `docker restart metube-dev-backend`

After first start `metube-dev-backend` may crashed with error about nonexistent files - it's normal, just wait while frontend will be build and restart backend.

### Run without docker

Make sure you have node.js and Python 3.8 installed.

```bash
cd metube/ui
# install Angular and build the UI
npm install
node_modules/.bin/ng build
# install python dependencies
cd ..
pip3 install pipenv
pipenv install
# run
pipenv run python3 app/main.py
```


## Development notes

* The above works on Windows and MacOS as well as Linux.
* If you're running the server in VSCode, your downloads will go to your user's Downloads folder (this is configured via the environment in .vscode/launch.json).
